# CMSE202-Project
Completed notebook is called "Insert Final Name Her".
All other files were partial versions used in collaboration, and can be ignored.
To run the notebook, simply run all cells from top to bottom.

*We still need to add our individual contributions on here, feel free to add your own below*

Individual Contributions:

Meghan Latouf: My contributions included functions toxins and temperature, some original stub functions with code for the bacteria/board, imports. I edited doc strings, death(for temperature), some animation/movement editing throughout creation of the project.

Bergen Kendziorski: My main contributions were in the bacteria reproduction (including finding openings) and death, as well as in the board initialization and display. I also added in the capability of 2 different bacteria types with the necessary changes to data collection, and made edits throughout the project.
