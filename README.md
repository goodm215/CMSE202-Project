# CMSE202-Project
Completed notebook is called "Science1_GroupB_FinalProject".
All other files were partial versions used in collaboration, and can be ignored.
To run the notebook, simply run all cells from top to bottom.

*We still need to add our individual contributions on here, feel free to add your own below*

Individual Contributions:

Meghan Latouf: My contributions included functions toxins and temperature, some original stub functions with code for the bacteria/board, imports. I edited doc strings, death(for temperature), some animation/movement editing throughout creation of the project.

Bergen Kendziorski: My main contributions were in the bacteria reproduction (including finding openings) and death, as well as in the board initialization and display. I also added in the capability of 2 different bacteria types with the necessary changes to data collection, and made edits throughout the project.

Daniel Goodman: My contributions include the mutate and movement functions for the bacteria class, mapping the bacteria gene values to colors when displaying the board, and tracking certain data points during the simulation such as bacteria count and average gene values. I also helped with the toxin aspect and worked on creating some of the graphs to display our results.
